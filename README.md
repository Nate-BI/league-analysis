## Introduction

We analyze whether **Mid** or **Bot** players contribute more to their teams in competitive League of Legends matches.

---

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

We removed team-level rows, filtered for player roles (top, jng, mid, bot, sup), and cleaned key columns (`kills`, `deaths`, `assists`, `dpm`).

### DPM Distribution

### DPM by Position

### KDA by Position

## Assessment of Missingness

We examined missingness in the `dpm` column and found that it is **likely not dependent** on team or position.

## Hypothesis Testing

We tested whether Mid and Bot players differ significantly in KDA using a permutation test.

**Null Hypothesis:** Mid and Bot players have the same KDA distribution.  
**Alternative Hypothesis:** Their KDA distributions are different.

## Framing a Prediction Problem

We aim to predict whether a player is **Mid** or **Bot** based on their performance stats.

---

## Baseline Model

We trained a logistic regression model using scaled numerical features.

## Final Model

We improved upon the baseline with feature transformations and a random forest classifier.

## Fairness Analysis

We tested whether the model's **precision** differs between Mid and Bot roles.  
No significant difference was found.
